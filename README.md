# Spot the Similar Symbol Game

This Python script generates two cards (lists) filled with random symbols.One symbol would be same in both the cards either at same or random positions and user has to spot that symbol.

## How it Works:
- Two lists (`card1` and `card2`) are created with 5 positions each.
- At random position  same symbol is placed in both cards.
- Other positions are filled with different random symbols, ensuring no repetitions.
- The user is asked to guess the same symbol that appears on both cards.

## Features:
- Randomized symbols and positions each time the game is played.
- Simple memory challenge for the user.

## Example Output:
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'] ['F', 'G', 'A', 'H', 'I'] Spot the similar symbol: A Right
